<h2><a name="History">17. Appendix: Revision History</a></h2>

<p>(This appendix is not part of the formal PNG specification.)

<p>The PNG format has been frozen since the Ninth Draft
of 7&nbsp;March&nbsp;1995, and all future changes are intended
to be backward compatible.
The revisions since the Ninth Draft are simply clarifications,
improvements in presentation, additions of supporting material, and
specifications for additional chunks.

<p>On 1 October 1996, the PNG 1.0 specification was approved as a
W3C (<a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>)
Recommendation.

<p>In January 1997 it was published as RFC-2083 (informational) with
technical content identical to that of the W3C Recommendation.

<p>In October 1998, the PNG 1.1 specification was approved by the
PNG Development Group, and it was released in December 1998.

<p>In February 1999, changes were approved by the PNG Development Group,
and the PNG 1.2 specification containing the changes was released
in July 1999.

<h3>Changes since version 1.1</h3>

Group, but not by any standards body.

dimensions to apply to all four-byte unsigned integers, and disallowed

converting it to binary transparency
