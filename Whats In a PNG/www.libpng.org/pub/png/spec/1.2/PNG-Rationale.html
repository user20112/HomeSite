<h2><a name="Rationale">12. Appendix: Rationale</a></h2>

<p>(This appendix is not part of the formal PNG specification.)

<p>This appendix gives the reasoning behind some of the design decisions
in PNG.  Many of these decisions were the subject of considerable
debate.  The authors freely admit that another group might have made
different decisions; however, we believe that our choices are defensible
and consistent.

<h3><a name="R.Why-a-new-file-format">12.1. Why a new file format?</a></h3>

<p>Does the world really need yet another graphics format?  We believe
so.  GIF is no longer freely usable, but no other commonly used format
can directly replace it, as is discussed in more detail below.  We might
have used an adaptation of an existing format, for example GIF with an
unpatented compression scheme.  But this would require new code anyway;
it would not be all that much easier to implement than a whole new file
format.  (PNG is designed to be simple to implement, with the exception
of the compression engine, which would be needed in any case.)  We feel
that this is an excellent opportunity to design a new format that fixes
some of the known limitations of GIF.

<h3><a name="R.Why-these-features">12.2. Why these features?</a></h3>

<p>The features chosen for PNG are intended to address the needs of
applications that previously used the special strengths of GIF.  In
particular, GIF is well adapted for online communications because of
its streamability and progressive display capability.  PNG shares those
attributes.

<p>We have also addressed some of the widely known shortcomings of GIF.
In particular, PNG supports truecolor images.  We know of no widely used
image format that losslessly compresses truecolor images as effectively
as PNG does.  We hope that PNG will make use of truecolor images more
practical and widespread.

<p>Some form of transparency control is desirable for applications in
which images are displayed against a background or together with other
images.  GIF provided a simple transparent-color specification for this
purpose.  PNG supports a full alpha channel as well as transparent-color
specifications.  This allows both highly flexible transparency and
compression efficiency.

<p>Robustness against transmission errors has been an important
consideration.  For example, images transferred across the Internet are
often mistakenly processed as text, leading to file corruption.  PNG is
designed so that such errors can be detected quickly and reliably.

<p>PNG has been expressly designed not to be completely dependent on a
single compression technique.  Although deflate/inflate compression is
mentioned in this document, PNG would still exist without it.

<h3><a name="R.Why-not-these-features">12.3. Why not these features?</a></h3>

<p>Some features have been deliberately omitted from PNG.  These choices
were made to simplify implementation of PNG, promote portability and
interchangeability, and make the format as simple and foolproof as
possible for users.  In particular:


<ul>

<li>There is no uncompressed variant of PNG.  It is possible to
store uncompressed data by using only uncompressed deflate blocks
(a feature normally used to guarantee that deflate does not make
incompressible data much larger).  However, PNG software must support
full deflate/inflate; any software that does not is not compliant with
the PNG standard.  The two most important features of PNG--portability
and compression--are absolute requirements for online applications,
and users demand them.  Failure to support full deflate/inflate
compromises both of these objectives.

<p>

<li>There is no lossy compression in PNG.  Existing formats such as JFIF
(JPEG File Interchange Format) already handle lossy compression well.
Furthermore, available lossy compression methods, e.g., the JPEG (Joint
Photographic Experts Group) algorithm, are far from foolproof--a poor
choice of quality level can ruin an image.  To avoid user confusion
and unintentional loss of information, we feel it is best to keep
lossy and lossless formats strictly separate.  Also, lossy compression
is complex to implement.  Adding JPEG support to a PNG decoder might
significantly increase its size, causing some decoders to omit support
for the feature, which would erode our goal of interchangeability.

<p>

<li>There is no support for CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, blacK) or
other unusual color spaces.  Again, this is in the name of promoting
portability.  CMYK, in particular, is far too device-dependent to be
useful as a portable image representation.

<p>

<li>There is no standard chunk for thumbnail views of images.  In
discussions with software vendors who use thumbnails in their products,
it has become clear that most would not use a "standard" thumbnail
chunk.  For one thing, every vendor has a different idea of what the
dimensions and characteristics of a thumbnail ought to be.  Also,
some vendors keep thumbnails in separate files to accommodate varied
image formats; they are not going to stop doing that simply because of
a thumbnail chunk in one new format.  Proprietary chunks containing
vendor-specific thumbnails appear to be more practical than a common
thumbnail format.

<p>

</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that private extensions to PNG could easily add
these features.  We will not, however, include them as part of the basic
PNG standard.


<p>PNG also does not support multiple images in one file.  This
restriction is a reflection of the reality that many applications
do not need and will not support multiple images per file.  In
any case, single images are a fundamentally different sort of
object from sequences of images.  Rather than make false promises
of interchangeability, we have drawn a clear distinction between
single-image and multi-image formats.  PNG is a single-image format.
(But see <a href="PNG-Misc.html#Multiple-image-extension">Multiple-image extension</a>.)

<h3><a name="R.Why-not-use-format-X">12.4. Why not use format X?</a></h3>

<p>We considered numerous existing formats before deciding to develop
PNG.  None could meet the requirements that we felt were important for PNG.

<p>GIF is no longer suitable as a universal standard because of legal
entanglements.  Although just replacing GIF's compression method would
avoid that problem, GIF does not support truecolor images, alpha
channels, or gamma correction.  The spec has more subtle problems too.
Only a small subset of the GIF89 spec is actually portable across a
variety of implementations, but there is no codification of the most
portable part of the spec.

<p>TIFF (the Tagged Image File Format) is far too complex to meet our
goals of simplicity and interchangeability.  Defining a TIFF subset
would meet that objection, but would frustrate users making the
reasonable assumption that a file saved as TIFF from their existing
software would load into a program supporting our flavor of TIFF.
Furthermore, TIFF is not designed for stream processing, has no
provision for progressive display, and does not currently provide any
good, legally unencumbered, lossless compression method.

<p>IFF has also been suggested, but is not suitable in detail: available
image representations are too machine-specific or not adequately
compressed.  The overall chunk structure of IFF is a useful concept
that PNG has liberally borrowed from, but we did not attempt to be
bit-for-bit compatible with IFF chunk structure.  Again this is due to
detailed issues, notably the fact that IFF FORMs are not designed to be
serially writable.

<p>Lossless JPEG is not suitable because it does not provide for the
storage of indexed-color images.  Furthermore, its lossless truecolor
compression is often inferior to that of PNG.


<h3><a name="R.Byte-order">12.5. Byte order</a></h3>

<p>It has been asked why PNG uses network byte order.  We have selected
one byte ordering and used it consistently.  Which order in particular
is of little relevance, but network byte order has the advantage that
routines to convert to and from it are already available on any platform
that supports TCP/IP networking, <strong>including</strong> all PC
platforms.  The functions are trivial and will be included in the
reference implementation.

<h3><a name="R.Interlacing">12.6. Interlacing</a></h3>

<p>PNG's two-dimensional interlacing scheme is more complex to implement
than GIF's line-wise interlacing.  It also costs a little more in
file size.  However, it yields an initial image <em>eight times</em>
faster than GIF (the first pass transmits only 1/64th of the pixels,
compared to 1/8th for GIF).  Although this initial image is coarse, it
is useful in many situations.  For example, if the image is a World
Wide Web imagemap that the user has seen before, PNG's first pass is
often enough to determine where to click.  The PNG scheme also looks
better than GIF's, because horizontal and vertical resolution never
differ by more than a factor of two; this avoids the
odd "stretched"
look seen when interlaced GIFs are filled in by replicating scanlines.
Preliminary results show that small text in an interlaced PNG image is
typically readable about twice as fast as in an equivalent GIF, i.e.,
after PNG's fifth pass or 25% of the image data, instead of after GIF's
third pass or 50%.  This is again due to PNG's more balanced increase in
resolution.

<h3><a name="R.Why-gamma">12.7. Why gamma?</a></h3>

<p>It might seem natural to standardize on storing sample values
proportional to display output intensity (that is, have gamma of 1.0).
But in fact, it is common for images to have a gamma of less than 1.
There are three good reasons for this:

<ul>

<li>CRTs have a transfer function with an exponent of <span class=expr>2.2</span>, and video
signals are designed to be sent directly to CRTs.  Therefore, images
obtained by frame-grabbing video already have a gamma of <span class=expr>1/2.2</span>.

<p>

<li>The human eye has a nonlinear response to intensity, so linear
encoding of samples either wastes sample codes in bright areas of the
image, or provides too few sample codes to avoid banding artifacts
in dark areas of the image, or both.  At least 12 bits per sample
are needed to avoid visible artifacts in linear encoding with a
100:1 image intensity range.  An image gamma in the range 0.3 to 0.5
allocates sample values in a way that roughly corresponds to the eye's
response, so that 8 bits/sample are enough to avoid artifacts caused by
insufficient sample precision in almost all images.  This makes "gamma
encoding" a much better way of storing digital images than the simpler
linear encoding.

<p>

<li>Many images are created on PCs or workstations with no gamma
correction hardware and no software willing to provide gamma correction
either.  In these cases, the images have had their lighting and color
chosen to look best on this platform--they can be thought of as
having "manual" gamma correction built in.
To see what the image author
intended, it is necessary to treat such images as having a gamma value
of <span class=expr>1/2.2</span> (assuming the author was using a CRT).

<p>

</ul>

<p>In practice, image gamma values around <span class=expr>1.0</span>, <span class=expr>1/2.2</span>,
and <span class=expr>1/1.45</span> are all
widely found.  Older image standards such as GIF and JFIF often do not
account for this fact.  The exchange of images among a variety of systems
has led to widespread problems with images appearing "too dark"
or "too light".

<p>PNG expects viewers to compensate for image gamma at the time that
the image is displayed.  Another possible approach is to expect encoders
to convert all images to a uniform gamma at encoding time.  While that
method would speed viewers slightly, it has fundamental flaws:

<ul>

<li>Gamma correction is inherently lossy due to quantization and
roundoff error.  Requiring conversion at encoding time thus causes
irreversible loss.  Since PNG is intended to be a lossless storage
format, this is undesirable; we should store unmodified source data.

<p>

<li>The encoder might not know the source gamma value.  If the decoder
does gamma correction at viewing time, it can adjust the gamma (change
the displayed brightness) in response to feedback from a human user.  The
encoder has no such recourse.

<p>

<li>Whatever "standard" gamma we settled on would be wrong for some
displays.  Hence viewers would still need gamma correction capability.

<p>

</ul>


<p>Since there will always be images with no gamma or an incorrect
recorded gamma, good viewers will need to incorporate gamma adjustment
code anyway.  Gamma correction at viewing time is thus the right way to
go.

<p>Historical note:  Version 1.0 of this specification used the
<span class=cn>gAMA</span> chunk to express the relationship between the file samples
and the "original scene intensity" (camera input) rather than the
desired display output intensity.  This was changed in version 1.1 for
the following reasons:

<ul>

<li>The decoder needs to know the desired display output in order
to do its job, but there was not enough information in the file to
convert from the original scene to the display output.  The version
1.0 specification claimed that the conversion depended only on viewing
conditions at the display, but that was an error; it also depends on
conditions at the camera.

<p>

<li>Faithful reproduction of the original scene is not always the goal.
Sometimes deliberate distortion is desired.

<p>

<li>For hand-drawn images there is no "original scene".

<p>

</ul>

<p>Because the gamma-related recommendations in version 1.0 were
imprecise, it was not clear what value to put in a <span class=cn>gAMA</span> chunk
in common situations.  For an image drawn on a CRT display with no
LUT under unknown viewing conditions, an argument could be made for
any value between 40000 and 50000.  Real applications were observed
to write 45000 or 45455, and the latter is recommended by the current
specification.

<p>See <a href="PNG-GammaAppendix.html">Gamma Tutorial</a> 
for more information.

<h3><a name="R.Non-premultiplied-alpha">12.8. Non-premultiplied alpha</a></h3>

<p>PNG uses "unassociated" or "non-premultiplied" alpha so that
images with separate transparency masks can be stored losslessly.
Another common technique, "premultiplied alpha", stores pixel values
premultiplied by the alpha fraction; in effect, the image is already
composited against a black background.  Any image data hidden by
the transparency mask is irretrievably lost by that method, since
multiplying by a zero alpha value always produces zero.

<p>Some image rendering techniques generate images with premultiplied
alpha (the alpha value actually represents how much of the pixel is
covered by the image).  This representation can be converted to PNG
by dividing the sample values by alpha, except where alpha is zero.
The result will look good if displayed by a viewer that handles alpha
properly, but will not look very good if the viewer ignores the alpha
channel.

<p>Although each form of alpha storage has its advantages, we did not
want to require all PNG viewers to handle both forms.  We standardized
on non-premultiplied alpha as being the lossless and more general case.

<h3><a name="R.Filtering">12.9. Filtering</a></h3>

<p>PNG includes filtering capability because filtering can significantly
reduce the compressed size of truecolor and grayscale images.  Filtering
is also sometimes of value on indexed-color images, although this is
less common.

<p>The filter algorithms are defined to operate on bytes, rather than
pixels; this gains simplicity and speed with very little cost in
compression performance.  Tests have shown that filtering is usually
ineffective for images with fewer than 8 bits per sample, so providing
pixelwise filtering for such images would be pointless.  For 16
bit/sample data, bytewise filtering is nearly as effective as pixelwise
filtering, because MSBs are predicted from adjacent MSBs, and LSBs are
predicted from adjacent LSBs.


<p>The encoder is allowed to change filters for each new scanline.
This creates no additional complexity for decoders, since a decoder is
required to contain defiltering logic for every filter type anyway.
The only cost is an extra byte per scanline in the pre-compression
datastream.  Our tests showed that when the same filter is selected for
all scanlines, this extra byte compresses away to almost nothing, so
there is little storage cost compared to a fixed filter specified for
the whole image.  And the potential benefits of adaptive filtering are
too great to ignore.  Even with the simplistic filter-choice heuristics
so far discovered, adaptive filtering usually outperforms fixed filters.
In particular, an adaptive filter can change behavior for successive
passes of an interlaced image; a fixed filter cannot.

<h3><a name="R.Text-strings">12.10. Text strings</a></h3>

<p>Most graphics file formats include the ability to store some textual
information along with the image.  But many applications need more than
that: they want to be able to store several identifiable pieces of text.
For example, a database using PNG files to store medical X-rays would
likely want to include patient's name, doctor's name, etc.  A simple way
to do this in PNG would be to invent new private chunks holding text.
The disadvantage of such an approach is that other applications would
have no idea what was in those chunks, and would simply ignore them.
Instead, we recommend that textual information be stored in standard
<span class=cn>text</span> chunks with suitable keywords.  Use of <span class=cn>text</span> tells
any PNG viewer that the chunk contains text that might be of interest to
a human user.  Thus, a person looking at the file with another viewer
will still be able to see the text, and even understand what it is
if the keywords are reasonably self-explanatory.  (To this end, we
recommend spelled-out keywords, not abbreviations that will be hard
for a person to understand.  Saving a few bytes on a keyword is false
economy.)

<p>The ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) character set was chosen as a compromise
between functionality and portability.  Some platforms cannot display
anything more than 7-bit ASCII characters, while others can handle
characters beyond the Latin-1 set.  We felt that Latin-1 represents
a widely useful and reasonably portable character set.  Latin-1 is a
direct subset of character sets commonly used on popular platforms such
as Microsoft Windows and X Windows.  It can also be handled on Macintosh
systems with a simple remapping of characters.

<h3><a name="R.iTXt">12.11. <span class=cn>iTXt</span></a></h3>

<p>This section gives the reasoning behind some of the design
decisions in the <span class=cn>iTXt</span> chunk.

<h4>Keyword: Why not Unicode?</h4>

<p>Unicode is too fancy for the keyword, which is intended for both machine
and human consumption.  Even applications without Unicode support
should at least be able to understand the keyword (to selectively delete
chunks, for example).

<h4>Keyword: Latin-1 vs. ASCII</h4>

<p>UTF-8 is used elsewhere in this chunk, and ASCII, unlike Latin-1,
is compatible with UTF-8.  There is a translated keyword, so
restricting the keyword to ASCII would not be a hardship.  So why
use Latin-1?  Because all other existing chunks containing keywords
use Latin-1, so applications can reuse code they already contain.

<h4>Compression flag and compression method: Why not combine them?</h4>

<p>We have deliberately avoided defining a null compression method in
the past (for <span class=cn>tEXt/zTXt</span>), so that there would be no temptation to
use it in <span class=cn>IHDR</span>.

<h4>Language tag:</h4>

<p>It is not always clear how to render Unicode text unless it is known
what language is represented by the text.  Also, multiple <span class=cn>iTXt</span>
chunks containing the same message in different languages could
be present, and a decoder could automatically select the one most
appropriate for its user.

<h4>Translated keyword:</h4>

<p>Registered keywords, like "Description", are registered only once,
in a single language (probably English), so that they can be
recognized automatically.  To be intelligible to speakers of another
language, a translation must be provided.

<h4>Text: Unicode vs. MIME charset name</h4>

<p>Including a MIME charset name would be more general, and allow the
use of legacy character sets.  But support for Unicode is growing,
and allowing only Unicode is conceptually simpler and likely to
eventually lead to greater interoperability.

<h4>UTF-8 vs. UCS-2 vs. UCS-4</h4>

<p>UCS-2 is short-sighted.  Neither UCS-2 nor UCS-4 is compatible with
ASCII.  UTF-8 is both backward compatible with ASCII and forward
compatible with UCS-4, and is generally the preferred encoding for
interchange (as opposed to internal representation).

<h3><a name="R.PNG-file-signature">12.12. PNG file signature</a></h3>

<p>The first eight bytes of a PNG file always contain the following
values:

<pre>
   (decimal)              137  80  78  71  13  10  26  10
   (hexadecimal)           89  50  4e  47  0d  0a  1a  0a
   (ASCII C notation)    \211   P   N   G  \r  \n \032 \n
</pre>

<p>This signature both identifies the file as a PNG file and provides
for immediate detection of common file-transfer problems.  The first
two bytes distinguish PNG files on systems that expect the first two
bytes to identify the file type uniquely.  The first byte is chosen
as a non-ASCII value to reduce the probability that a text file may
be misrecognized as a PNG file; also, it catches bad file transfers
that clear bit 7.  Bytes two through four name the format.  The CR-LF
sequence catches bad file transfers that alter newline sequences.  The
control-Z character stops file display under MS-DOS.  The final line
feed checks for the inverse of the CR-LF translation problem.

<p>A decoder may further verify that the next eight bytes contain an
<span class=cn>IHDR</span> chunk header with the correct chunk length; this will
catch bad transfers that drop or alter null (zero) bytes.

<p>Note that there is no version number in the signature, nor indeed
anywhere in the file.  This is intentional: the chunk mechanism provides
a better, more flexible way to handle format extensions, as explained in
<a href="PNG-Rationale.html#R.Chunk-naming-conventions">Chunk naming conventions</a>.

<h3><a name="R.Chunk-layout">12.13. Chunk layout</a></h3>

<p>The chunk design allows decoders to skip unrecognized or
uninteresting chunks: it is simply necessary to skip the appropriate
number of bytes, as determined from the length field.

<p>
Limiting chunk length to <code class=expr><lp>2<sup>31</sup><rp>-1</code> bytes avoids possible problems for
implementations that cannot conveniently handle 4-byte unsigned values.
In practice, chunks will usually be much shorter than that anyway.

<p>A separate CRC is provided for each chunk in order to detect
badly-transferred images as quickly as possible.  In particular,
critical data such as the image dimensions can be validated before being
used.

<p>The chunk length is excluded from the CRC so that the CRC can be
calculated as the data is generated; this avoids a second pass over the
data in cases where the chunk length is not known in advance.  Excluding
the length from the CRC does not create any extra risk of failing to
discover file corruption, since if the length is wrong, the CRC check
will fail: the CRC will be computed on the wrong set of bytes and then
be tested against the wrong value from the file.

<h3><a name="R.Chunk-naming-conventions">12.14. Chunk naming conventions</a></h3>

<p>The chunk naming conventions allow safe, flexible extension of the
PNG format.  This mechanism is much better than a format version number,
because it works on a feature-by-feature basis rather than being an
overall indicator.  Decoders can process newer files if and only if the
files use no unknown critical features (as indicated by finding unknown
critical chunks).  Unknown ancillary chunks can be safely ignored.
We decided against having an overall format version number because
experience has shown that format version numbers hurt portability as
much as they help.  Version numbers tend to be set unnecessarily high,
leading to older decoders rejecting files that they could have processed
(this was a serious problem for several years after the GIF89 spec came
out, for example).  Furthermore, private extensions can be made either
critical or ancillary, and standard decoders should react appropriately;
overall version numbers are no help for private extensions.

<p>A hypothetical chunk for vector graphics would be a critical chunk,
since if ignored, important parts of the intended image would be
missing.  A chunk carrying the Mandelbrot set coordinates for a fractal
image would be ancillary, since other applications could display the
image without understanding what the image represents.  In general, a
chunk type should be made critical only if it is impossible to display
a reasonable representation of the intended image without interpreting
that chunk.


<p>The public/private property bit ensures that any newly defined public
chunk type name cannot conflict with proprietary chunks that could be in
use somewhere.  However, this does not protect users of private chunk
names from the possibility that someone else may use the same chunk
name for a different purpose.  It is a good idea to put additional
identifying information at the start of the data for any private chunk
type.

<p>When a PNG file is modified, certain ancillary chunks may need
to be changed to reflect changes in other chunks.  For example, a
histogram chunk needs to be changed if the image data changes.  If the
file editor does not recognize histogram chunks, copying them blindly
to a new output file is incorrect; such chunks should be dropped.
The safe/unsafe property bit allows ancillary chunks to be marked
appropriately.

<p>Not all possible modification scenarios are covered by the
safe/unsafe semantics.  In particular, chunks that are dependent on the
total file contents are not supported.  (An example of such a chunk
is an index of <span class=cn>IDAT</span> chunk locations within the file: adding
a comment chunk would inadvertently break the index.)  Definition of
such chunks is discouraged.  If absolutely necessary for a particular
application, such chunks can be made critical chunks, with consequent
loss of portability to other applications.  In general, ancillary chunks
can depend on critical chunks but not on other ancillary chunks.  It is
expected that mutually dependent information should be put into a single
chunk.

<p>In some situations it may be unavoidable to make one ancillary
chunk dependent on another.  Although the chunk property bits are
insufficient to represent this case, a simple solution is available: in
the dependent chunk, record the CRC of the chunk depended on.  It can
then be determined whether that chunk has been changed by some other
program.

<p>The same technique can be useful for other purposes.  For example,
if a program relies on the palette being in a particular order, it can
store a private chunk containing the CRC of the <span class=cn>PLTE</span> chunk.
If this value matches when the file is again read in, then it provides
high confidence that the palette has not been tampered with.  Note that
it is not necessary to mark the private chunk unsafe-to-copy when this
technique is used; thus, such a private chunk can survive other editing
of the file.


<h3><a name="R.Palette-histograms">12.15. Palette histograms</a></h3>

<p>A viewer may not be able to provide as many colors as are listed
in the image's palette.  (For example, some colors could be reserved
by a window system.)  To produce the best results in this situation,
it is helpful to have information about the frequency with which each
palette index actually appears, in order to choose the best palette for
dithering or to drop the least-used colors.  Since images are often
created once and viewed many times, it makes sense to calculate this
information in the encoder, although it is not mandatory for the encoder
to provide it.

<p>Other image formats have usually addressed this problem by specifying
that the palette entries should appear in order of frequency of use.
That is an inferior solution, because it doesn't give the viewer nearly
as much information: the viewer can't determine how much damage will be
done by dropping the last few colors.  Nor does a sorted palette give
enough information to choose a target palette for dithering, in the case
that the viewer needs to reduce the number of colors substantially.
A palette histogram provides the information needed to choose such a
target palette without making a pass over the image data.
