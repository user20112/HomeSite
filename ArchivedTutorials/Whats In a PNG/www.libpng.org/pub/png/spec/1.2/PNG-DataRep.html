<h2><a name="DataRep">2. Data Representation</a></h2>

<p>This chapter discusses basic data representations used in PNG files,
as well as the expected representation of the image data.

<h3><a name="DR.Integers-and-byte-order">2.1. Integers and byte order</a></h3>

<p>All integers that require more than one byte must be in network
byte order: the most significant byte comes first, then the less
significant bytes in descending order of significance (MSB LSB for
two-byte integers, B3 B2 B1 B0 for four-byte integers).  The highest
bit (value 128) of a byte is numbered bit 7; the lowest bit (value 1)
is numbered bit 0.  Values are unsigned unless otherwise noted.  Values
explicitly noted as signed are represented in two's complement notation.

<p>Unless otherwise stated, four-byte unsigned integers are limited to
the range <code class=expr>0</code> to <code class=expr><lp>2<sup>31</sup><rp>-1</code> to accommodate languages
that have difficulty
with unsigned four-byte values.  Similarly, four-byte signed integers
are limited to the range <code class=expr>-(<lp>2<sup>31</sup><rp>-1)</code> to <code class=expr><lp>2<sup>31</sup><rp>-1</code> to
accommodate languages that have difficulty with the value <code class=expr>-2<sup>31</sup></code>.

<p>See Rationale: <a href="PNG-Rationale.html#R.Byte-order">Byte order</a>.

<h3><a name="DR.Color-values">2.2. Color values</a></h3>

<p>Colors can be represented by either grayscale or RGB (red, green,
blue) sample data.  Grayscale data represents luminance; RGB data
represents calibrated color information (if the <span class=cn>cHRM</span> chunk
is present) or uncalibrated device-dependent color (if <span class=cn>cHRM</span>
is absent).  All color values range from zero (representing black) to
most intense at the maximum value for the sample depth.  Note that
the maximum value at a given sample depth is <code class=expr><lp>2<sup>sampledepth</sup><rp>-1</code>, not
<code class=expr>2<sup>sampledepth</sup></code>.

<p>Sample values are not necessarily proportional to light intensity;
the <span class=cn>gAMA</span> chunk specifies the relationship between sample values
and display output intensity, and viewers are strongly encouraged
to compensate properly.  See <a href="PNG-DataRep.html#DR.Gamma-correction">Gamma correction</a>.

<p>Source data with a precision not directly supported in PNG (for
example, 5 bit/sample truecolor) must be scaled up to the next higher
supported bit depth.  This scaling is reversible with no loss of data,
and it reduces the number of cases that decoders have to cope with.
See Recommendations for Encoders: <a href="PNG-Encoders.html#E.Sample-depth-scaling" >Sample depth scaling</a> 
and Recommendations for Decoders: <a href="PNG-Decoders.html#D.Sample-depth-rescaling">Sample depth rescaling</a>.

<h3><a name="DR.Image-layout">2.3. Image layout</a></h3>

<p>Conceptually, a PNG image is a rectangular pixel array, with
pixels appearing left-to-right within each scanline, and scanlines
appearing top-to-bottom.  (For progressive display purposes, the
data may actually be transmitted in a different order; see <a href="PNG-DataRep.html#DR.Interlaced-data-order">Interlaced data order</a>.)  
The size
of each pixel is determined by the <em>bit depth</em>, which is the
number of bits per sample in the image data.

<p>Three types of pixel are supported:

<ul>

<li>An <em>indexed-color</em> pixel is represented by a single sample
that is an index into a supplied palette.  The image bit depth
determines the maximum number of palette entries, but not the color
precision within the palette.

<p>

<li>A <em>grayscale</em> pixel is represented by a single sample that is
a grayscale level, where zero is black and the largest value for the bit
depth is white.

<p>

<li>A <em>truecolor</em> pixel is represented by three samples: red
(zero = black, max = red) appears first, then green (zero = black, max =
green), then blue (zero = black, max = blue).  The bit depth specifies
the size of each sample, not the total pixel size.

<p>

</ul>

<p>Optionally, grayscale and truecolor pixels can also include an alpha
sample, as described in the next section.

<p>Pixels are always packed into scanlines with no wasted bits between
pixels.  Pixels smaller than a byte never cross byte boundaries; they
are packed into bytes with the leftmost pixel in the high-order bits of
a byte, the rightmost in the low-order bits.  Permitted bit depths and
pixel types are restricted so that in all cases the packing is simple
and efficient.

<p>PNG permits multi-sample pixels only with 8- and 16-bit samples, so
multiple samples of a single pixel are never packed into one byte.  All
16-bit samples are stored in network byte order (MSB first).

<p>Scanlines always begin on byte boundaries.  When pixels have fewer
than 8 bits and the scanline width is not evenly divisible by the number
of pixels per byte, the low-order bits in the last byte of each scanline
are wasted.  The contents of these wasted bits are unspecified.

<p>An additional "filter-type" byte is added to the beginning
of every
scanline (see <a href="PNG-DataRep.html#DR.Filtering">Filtering</a>).  
The filter-type
byte is not considered part of the image data, but it is included in the
datastream sent to the compression step.

<h3><a name="DR.Alpha-channel">2.4. Alpha channel</a></h3>

<p>An alpha channel, representing transparency information on a
per-pixel basis, can be included in grayscale and truecolor PNG images.

<p>An alpha value of zero represents full transparency, and a value of
<code class=expr><lp>2<sup>bitdepth</sup><rp>-1</code> represents a fully opaque pixel.
Intermediate values
indicate partially transparent pixels that can be combined with a
background image to yield a composite image.  (Thus, alpha is really
the degree of opacity of the pixel.  But most people refer to alpha as
providing transparency information, not opacity information, and we
continue that custom here.)

<p>Alpha channels can be included with images that have either 8 or
16 bits per sample, but not with images that have fewer than 8 bits
per sample.  Alpha samples are represented with the same bit depth
used for the image samples.  The alpha sample for each pixel is stored
immediately following the grayscale or RGB samples of the pixel.


<p>The color values stored for a pixel are not affected by the
alpha value assigned to the pixel.  This rule is sometimes called
"unassociated" or "non-premultiplied" alpha.
(Another common technique
is to store sample values premultiplied by the alpha fraction; in
effect, such an image is already composited against a black background.
PNG does <em>not</em> use premultiplied alpha.)

<p>Transparency control is also possible without the storage cost of
a full alpha channel.  In an indexed-color image, an alpha value can
be defined for each palette entry.  In grayscale and truecolor images,
a single pixel value can be identified as being "transparent".
These techniques are controlled by the <span class=cn>tRNS</span> ancillary chunk type.

<p>If no alpha channel nor <span class=cn>tRNS</span> chunk is present, all pixels in
the image are to be treated as fully opaque.

<p>Viewers can support transparency control partially, or not at all.

<p>See Rationale: <a href="PNG-Rationale.html#R.Non-premultiplied-alpha" >Non-premultiplied alpha</a>, 
Recommendations for Encoders: <a href="PNG-Encoders.html#E.Alpha-channel-creation">Alpha channel creation</a>, 
and
Recommendations for Decoders: <a href="PNG-Decoders.html#D.Alpha-channel-processing" >Alpha channel processing</a>.

<h3><a name="DR.Filtering">2.5. Filtering</a></h3>

<p>PNG allows the image data to be <em>filtered</em> before it is
compressed.  Filtering can improve the compressibility of the data.
The filter step itself does not reduce the size of the data.  All PNG
filters are strictly lossless.

<p>PNG defines several different filter algorithms,
including "None"
which indicates no filtering.  The filter algorithm is specified for
each scanline by a filter-type byte that precedes the filtered scanline
in the precompression datastream.  An intelligent encoder can switch
filters from one scanline to the next.  The method for choosing which
filter to employ is up to the encoder.

<p>See <a href="PNG-Filters.html">Filter Algorithms</a> 
and Rationale: <a href="PNG-Rationale.html#R.Filtering">Filtering</a>.

<h3><a name="DR.Interlaced-data-order">2.6. Interlaced data order</a></h3>

<p>A PNG image can be stored in interlaced order to allow progressive
display.  The purpose of this feature is to allow images
to "fade in"
when they are being displayed on-the-fly.  Interlacing slightly expands
the file size on average, but it gives the user a meaningful display
much more rapidly.  Note that decoders are required to be able to read
interlaced images, whether or not they actually perform progressive
display.

<p>With interlace method 0, pixels are stored sequentially from left to
right, and scanlines sequentially from top to bottom (no interlacing).

<p>Interlace method 1, known as Adam7 after its author, Adam
M. Costello, consists of seven distinct passes over the image.  Each
pass transmits a subset of the pixels in the image.  The pass in which
each pixel is transmitted is defined by replicating the following 8-by-8
pattern over the entire image, starting at the upper left corner:

<pre>
   1 6 4 6 2 6 4 6
   7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
   5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6
   7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
   3 6 4 6 3 6 4 6
   7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
   5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6
   7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
</pre>

<p>Within each pass, the selected pixels are transmitted left to
right within a scanline, and selected scanlines sequentially from top
to bottom.  For example, pass 2 contains pixels 4, 12, 20, etc. of
scanlines 0, 8, 16, etc. (numbering from 0,0 at the upper left corner).
The last pass contains the entirety of scanlines 1, 3, 5, etc.

<p><strong>The data within each pass is laid out as though it were a
complete image of the appropriate dimensions.</strong>  For example, if
the complete image is 16 by 16 pixels, then pass 3 will contain two
scanlines, each containing four pixels.  When pixels have fewer than 8
bits, each such scanline is padded as needed to fill an integral number
of bytes (see <a href="PNG-DataRep.html#DR.Image-layout">Image layout</a>).  
Filtering
is done on this reduced image in the usual way, and a filter-type byte
is transmitted before each of its scanlines (see <a href="PNG-Filters.html" >Filter Algorithms</a>).  
Notice that the transmission order is defined
so that all the scanlines transmitted in a pass will have the same
number of pixels; this is necessary for proper application of some of
the filters.

<p><strong>Caution:</strong> If the image contains fewer than five
columns or fewer than five rows, some passes will be entirely empty.
Encoders and decoders must handle this case correctly.  In particular,
filter-type bytes are associated only with nonempty scanlines; no
filter-type bytes are present in an empty pass.

<p>See Rationale: <a href="PNG-Rationale.html#R.Interlacing">Interlacing</a> 
and
Recommendations for Decoders: <a href="PNG-Decoders.html#D.Progressive-display" >Progressive display</a>.

<h3><a name="DR.Gamma-correction">2.7. Gamma correction</a></h3>

<p>PNG images can specify, via the <span class=cn>gAMA</span> chunk, the power
function relating the desired display output with the image samples.
Display programs are strongly encouraged to use this information, plus
information about the display system they are using, to present the
image to the viewer in a way that reproduces what the image's original
author saw as closely as possible.  See <a href="PNG-GammaAppendix.html">Gamma Tutorial</a> 
if you aren't already familiar with gamma issues.

<p>Gamma correction is not applied to the alpha channel, if any.  Alpha
samples always represent a linear fraction of full opacity.

<p>For high-precision applications, the exact chromaticity of the RGB
data in a PNG image can be specified via the <span class=cn>cHRM</span> chunk,
allowing more accurate color matching than gamma correction alone
will provide.  If the RGB data conforms to the sRGB specification
<span class=ref>[<a href="PNG-References.html#B.sRGB">sRGB</a>]</span>, 
this can be indicated with
the <span class=cn>sRGB</span> chunk, enabling even more accurate reproduction.
Alternatively, the <span class=cn>iCCP</span> chunk can be used to embed an ICC profile
<span class=ref>[<a href="PNG-References.html#B.ICC">ICC</a>]</span> 
containing detailed color space
information.  See <a href="PNG-ColorAppendix.html">Color Tutorial</a> 
if you
aren't already familiar with color representation issues.

<p>See Rationale: <a href="PNG-Rationale.html#R.Why-gamma">Why gamma?</a>,
Recommendations for Encoders: <a href="PNG-Encoders.html#E.Encoder-gamma-handling" >Encoder gamma handling</a>, 
and Recommendations for Decoders: <a href="PNG-Decoders.html#D.Decoder-gamma-handling">Decoder gamma handling</a>.

<h3><a name="DR.Text-strings">2.8. Text strings</a></h3>

<p>A PNG file can store text associated with the image, such as an image
description or copyright notice.  Keywords are used to indicate what
each text string represents.

<p>ISO/IEC 8859-1 (Latin-1) is the character set recommended for use in
the text strings appearing in <span class=cn>tEXt</span> and <span class=cn>zTXt</span>
chunks <span class=ref>[<a href="PNG-References.html#B.I-8859-1">ISO/IEC-8859-1</a>]</span>.  
It
is a superset of 7-bit ASCII.  If it is
necessary to convey characters outside of the Latin-1 set, the
<span class=cn>iTXt</span> chunk should be used instead.

<p>Character codes not defined in Latin-1 should not be used in
<span class=cn>tEXt</span> and <span class=cn>zTXt</span> chunks, because
they have no platform-independent meaning.  If a non-Latin-1 code
does appear in a PNG text string, its interpretation will vary across
platforms and decoders.  Some systems might not even be able to display
all the characters in Latin-1, but most modern systems can.

<p>Provision is also made for the storage of compressed text.
