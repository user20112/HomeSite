<h2><a name="Compression">5. Deflate/Inflate Compression</a></h2>

<p>PNG compression method 0 (the only compression method presently
defined for PNG) specifies deflate/inflate compression with a sliding
window of at most 32768 bytes.  Deflate compression is an LZ77
derivative used in zip, gzip, pkzip, and related programs.  Extensive
research has been done supporting its patent-free status.  Portable C
implementations are freely available.

<p>Deflate-compressed datastreams within PNG are stored in
the "zlib" format, which has the structure:

<pre>
   Compression method/flags code: 1 byte
   Additional flags/check bits:   1 byte
   Compressed data blocks:        n bytes
   Check value:                   4 bytes
</pre>

<p>Further details on this format are given in the zlib specification
<span class=ref>[<a href="PNG-References.html#B.RFC-1950">RFC-1950</a>]</span>.

<p>For PNG compression method 0, the zlib compression method/flags code
must specify method code 8 ("deflate" compression) and an LZ77
window size of not more than 32768 bytes.  Note that the zlib compression
method number is not the same as the PNG compression method number.  The
additional flags must not specify a preset dictionary.  A PNG decoder
must be able to decompress any valid zlib datastream that satisfies
these additional constraints.

<p>If the data to be compressed contains 16384 bytes or fewer, the
encoder can set the window size by rounding up to a power of 2 (256
minimum).  This decreases the memory required not only for encoding but
also for decoding, without adversely affecting the compression ratio.

<p>The compressed data within the zlib datastream is stored as a
series of blocks, each of which can represent raw (uncompressed)
data, LZ77-compressed data encoded with fixed Huffman codes, or
LZ77-compressed data encoded with custom Huffman codes.  A marker bit in
the final block identifies it as the last block, allowing the decoder
to recognize the end of the compressed datastream.  Further details on
the compression algorithm and the encoding are given in the deflate
specification <span class=ref>[<a href="PNG-References.html#B.RFC-1951">RFC-1951</a>]</span>.

<p>The check value stored at the end of the zlib datastream is
calculated on the uncompressed data represented by the datastream.  Note
that the algorithm used is not the same as the CRC calculation used
for PNG chunk check values.  The zlib check value is useful mainly as
a cross-check that the deflate and inflate algorithms are implemented
correctly.  Verifying the chunk CRCs provides adequate confidence that
the PNG file has been transmitted undamaged.

<p>In a PNG file, the concatenation of the contents of all the
<span class=cn>IDAT</span> chunks makes up a zlib datastream as specified above.
This datastream decompresses to filtered image data as described
elsewhere in this document.

<p>It is important to emphasize that the boundaries between
<span class=cn>IDAT</span> chunks are arbitrary and can fall anywhere in the
zlib datastream.  There is not necessarily any correlation between
<span class=cn>IDAT</span> chunk boundaries and deflate block boundaries or any other
feature of the zlib data.  For example, it is entirely possible for the
terminating zlib check value to be split across <span class=cn>IDAT</span> chunks.


<p>In the same vein, there is no required correlation between the
structure of the image data (i.e., scanline boundaries) and deflate
block boundaries or <span class=cn>IDAT</span> chunk boundaries.  The complete image
data is represented by a single zlib datastream that is stored in
some number of <span class=cn>IDAT</span> chunks; a decoder that assumes any more
than this is incorrect.  (Of course, some encoder implementations may
emit files in which some of these structures are indeed related.  But
decoders cannot rely on this.)

<p>PNG also uses zlib datastreams in <span class=cn>iTXt</span>, <span class=cn>zTXt</span>, and
<span class=cn>iCCP</span>
chunks, where the remainder of the chunk following the compression
method byte is a zlib datastream as specified above.  Unlike the image
data, such datastreams are not split across chunks; each <span class=cn>iTXt</span>,
<span class=cn>zTXt</span>,
or <span class=cn>iCCP</span> chunk contains an independent zlib datastream.

<p>Additional documentation and portable C code for deflate
and inflate are available from the Info-ZIP archives
at <span class=url><a href="ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/" >ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/</a></span>.
