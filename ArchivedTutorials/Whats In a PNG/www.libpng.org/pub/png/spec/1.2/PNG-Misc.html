<h2><a name="Misc">8. Miscellaneous Topics</a></h2>

<h3><a name="File-name-extension">8.1. File name extension</a></h3>

<p>On systems where file names customarily include an extension
signifying file type, the extension ".png" is recommended for
PNG files.  Lowercase ".png" is preferred if file names are
case-sensitive.

<h3><a name="Media-type">8.2. Internet media type</a></h3>

<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has registered
"image/png" as the Internet Media Type for PNG <span class=ref>[<a href="PNG-References.html#B.RFC-2045">RFC-2045</a>]</span>, 
<span class=ref>[<a href="PNG-References.html#B.RFC-2048" >RFC-2048</a>]</span>.  
For robustness, decoders may choose to also
support the interim media type "image/x-png" that was in use before
registration was complete.

<h3><a name="Macintosh-file-layout">8.3. Macintosh file layout</a></h3>

<p>In the Apple Macintosh system, the following conventions are
recommended:

<ul>

<li>The four-byte file type code for PNG files is "PNGf".
(This code has been registered with Apple for PNG files.)  The creator
code will vary depending on the creating application.

<p>

<li>The contents of the data fork must be a PNG file exactly as
described in the rest of this specification.

<p>

<li>The contents of the resource fork are unspecified.  It may be empty
or may contain application-dependent resources.

<p>

<li>When transferring a Macintosh PNG file to a non-Macintosh system,
only the data fork should be transferred.

<p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="Multiple-image-extension">8.4. Multiple-image extension</a></h3>

<p>PNG itself is strictly a single-image format.  However, it
may be necessary to store multiple images within one file; for
example, this is needed to convert GIF animation files.  The PNG Development
Group has defined and approved a multiple-image format based on PNG, called 
"Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG)" <span class=ref>[<a href="PNG-References.html#B.MNG" >MNG</a>]</span>.
This is considered a separate file format and has a different
signature.  PNG-supporting applications may or may not choose to support
the multiple-image format.

<p>See Rationale: <a href="PNG-Rationale.html#R.Why-not-these-features">Why not these features?</a>.

<h3><a name="Security-considerations">8.5. Security considerations</a></h3>

<p>A PNG file or datastream is composed of a collection of explicitly
typed "chunks".  Chunks whose contents are defined by the
specification
could actually contain anything, including malicious code.  But there
is no known risk that such malicious code could be executed on the
recipient's computer as a result of decoding the PNG image.

<p>The possible security risks associated with private chunk types and
future chunk types cannot be specified at this time.  Security issues
will be considered when evaluating chunks proposed for registration
as public chunks.  There is no additional security risk associated
with unknown or unimplemented chunk types, because such chunks will be
ignored, or at most be copied into another PNG file.

<p>The <span class=cn>text</span> chunks contain keywords and data
that is meant to be displayed as plain text.  The <span class=cn>iCCP</span>,
<span class=cn>sPLT</span>,
and some public "extension" chunks contain keywords meant to
be displayed as plain text.  It is possible that if a decoder displays
such text without filtering out control characters, especially the
ESC (escape) character, certain systems or terminals could behave in
undesirable and insecure ways.  We recommend that decoders filter out
control characters to avoid this risk; see Recommendations for Decoders:
<a href="PNG-Decoders.html#D.Text-chunk-processing">Text chunk processing</a>.

<p>Every chunk begins with a length field, making it easier to
write decoders invulnerable to fraudulent chunks that attempt to
overflow buffers.  The CRC at the end of every chunk provides a
robust defense against accidentally corrupted data.  Also, the PNG
signature bytes provide early detection of common file transmission errors.

<p>A decoder that fails to check CRCs could be subject to data
corruption.  The only likely consequence of such corruption is
incorrectly displayed pixels within the image.  Worse things might
happen if the CRC of the <span class=cn>IHDR</span> chunk is not checked and the
width or height fields are corrupted.  See Recommendations for Decoders:
<a href="PNG-Decoders.html#D.Error-checking">Error checking</a>.

<p>A poorly written decoder might be subject to buffer overflow, because
chunks can be extremely large, up to <code class=expr><lp>2<sup>31</sup><rp>-1</code> bytes long.  But
properly written decoders will handle large chunks without difficulty.
