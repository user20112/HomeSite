			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello,</p>
            <p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my site, my names Devlin im a computer programming and engineering major over at the tech in concord. I'm currently employed at Baked in concord at 246 Sheep Davis road as a shift leader. If you find anything that i could improve about either this site the aspnet site linked on the other tab or really any facet of myself please send me a message id love to hear it. </p>
			<p>Any way have a nice rest of your day</p>
            
			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p> Server Managing: I currently have 2 servers an R610 mostly stock i bought of craigslist with 1.2 terabytes of raid 1 harddrives. And an R710 server running 2 Xeon 5687 cpus filled with 64 gigs of ram (4 gig sticks sadly :/) and 1.5 terbytes of hardrive storage also in raid 1.</p>
			<p>Site Management: Theres this site and the aspnet site you can view to the left in one of the navagation panels. Doing sites like these honestly just helps me understand the material better and it gives me a nice way to spend time when i have it off.</p>
            <p>PC Building: Long before i was building servers i built PCs. over time i built more interesting setups including a one inside a backpack protected by the top of a trashcan. and one that had a laptop motherboard behind the motherboard back of the main pc that it used as a wireless adapter. this came about due to me being to cheap to buy an adapter yet a family member was tossing an old rundown inspiron laptop.</p>
            <p>C++, C#, Java, Ruby, Python, etc coding. These usually take the form of small applications I use to supliment those i cant find online. My first example of this was a finance management application done as a WPF application to help me manage my money. this was later ported to my aspnet site (private view for obviose reasons)</p>
            <p>If you have any project suggestions id lvoe to hear it</p>
            
            <p></p>
